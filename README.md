# Embedded System Learning Journey 🔌⚡

Welcome to my embeded system learning repository! This is a comprehensive guide to understanding electronics from the ground up, written by a software engineer learning hardware.

## 📚 About This Project

This repository documents my journey learning embedded systems, from the most basic concepts (what is charge?) to more advanced topics. Everything is explained in plain English with practical examples, analogies, and hands-on exercises.

**Target Audience:** Complete beginners with no prior hardware/electronics knowledge

**Approach:** Learn by understanding, not memorizing. Every concept is explained with:
- Clear, jargon-free explanations
- Real-world analogies (water flow, gravity, everyday examples)
- Practical calculations and examples
- Visual diagrams and tables
- Practice problems with solutions

## 🎯 Learning Philosophy

- **Start from atoms** - Understand what electricity actually is
- **Build incrementally** - Each concept builds on previous ones
- **Practice actively** - Do calculations, build circuits, measure things
- **Use analogies** - Make abstract concepts concrete
- **Be beginner-friendly** - No assumed knowledge

## 📖 Chapters

### ✅ [Chapter 1: Foundational Electronics](./chapter-1-foundational-electronics/)

Master the fundamental concepts that form the foundation of all electronics:

- **Charge and Atoms** - What electricity is at the atomic level
- **Electric Fields** - Invisible force zones around charges
- **Ions and Charge Separation** - How charges get separated
- **Battery Working** - How batteries create and maintain voltage
- **Voltage** - Electrical pressure that pushes electrons
- **Current** - The flow of electrons through conductors
- **Resistance** - Opposition to current flow
- **Ohm's Law** - The most important formula: V = I × R
- **Power** - Energy used per second, heating, and efficiency
- **Units and Conversions** - Working with mA, kΩ, mW, and more
- **Summary and Practice** - Review and test your knowledge

**Prerequisites:** None! Completely beginner-friendly.

**Time to Complete:** 4-10 hours depending on depth

## 👤 About the Author

I'm a software engineer learning electronics as a hobby and to expand my skills into hardware. Coming from a software background, I focus on:

- Clear, logical explanations
- Breaking complex topics into simple pieces
- Using analogies that make sense to beginners
- Providing practical, working examples
- Writing documentation that I wish existed when I started

This repository is both my learning notes and a resource for others on the same journey.
