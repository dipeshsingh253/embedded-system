# Charge and Atoms

## What Are Atoms?

Everything around you—your phone, the air, your body—is made of tiny particles called **atoms**. Atoms are so small that you can't see them even with a regular microscope. But understanding atoms is the key to understanding electricity.

### Structure of an Atom

An atom has three types of particles:

1. **Protons** ⚛️
   - Positively charged (+)
   - Located in the nucleus (center)
   - Very heavy
   - **Cannot move** (stuck in the nucleus)

2. **Neutrons** ⚪
   - No charge (neutral)
   - Located in the nucleus (center)
   - Very heavy
   - Cannot move (stuck in the nucleus)

3. **Electrons** ⚡
   - Negatively charged (-)
   - Orbit around the nucleus
   - Very light (about 1/2000th the mass of a proton)
   - **Can move!** This is super important for electricity

### Visual Model

```
        Electrons (-)
          •  •  •
        •         •
       •    ⚛️    •    ← Nucleus (protons + neutrons)
        •         •
          •  •  •
```

## What Is Charge?

**Charge** is a fundamental property of matter. Think of it like "electrical flavors"—things can be positive, negative, or neutral.

### Two Types of Charge

- **Positive charge (+)**: What protons have
- **Negative charge (-)**: What electrons have

### The Key Rule

> **Opposites attract, likes repel**
> - Positive and negative charges pull toward each other
> - Two positive charges push away from each other
> - Two negative charges push away from each other

This is similar to magnets, but with electrical charge instead of magnetic poles.

## Why Materials Are Normally Neutral

In most atoms, the number of protons equals the number of electrons:

```
Protons (+) = Electrons (-)
```

The positive and negative charges cancel out, making the atom **electrically neutral**.

Example:
- A carbon atom has 6 protons (+6) and 6 electrons (-6)
- Total charge: +6 + (-6) = 0 (neutral)

This is why most objects don't shock you or attract/repel each other—they're balanced.

## Example: Copper Atom

Copper is one of the most important materials in electronics because it conducts electricity so well. Let's look at why.

### Copper Atom Structure

- **29 protons** in the nucleus (+29 charge)
- **29 electrons** orbiting the nucleus (-29 charge)
- Total charge: +29 + (-29) = 0 (neutral)

### Electron Shells

Electrons orbit the nucleus in different "shells" or energy levels, like layers of an onion:

```
Shell 1 (closest): 2 electrons
Shell 2: 8 electrons
Shell 3: 18 electrons
Shell 4 (outermost): 1 electron  ← This one is special!
```

The **outermost electron** in copper is only loosely attached. It's called a **valence electron** or **free electron**.

## Free Electrons in Metals

In a piece of copper wire, you have billions and billions of copper atoms all packed together. Each atom contributes its outermost electron to a shared "sea of electrons."

### The Electron Sea

```
  Cu⁺   Cu⁺   Cu⁺   Cu⁺
    •  •  •  •  •  •     ← Free electrons
  Cu⁺   Cu⁺   Cu⁺   Cu⁺
    •  •  •  •  •  •     ← These can move!
  Cu⁺   Cu⁺   Cu⁺   Cu⁺
```

- The copper atoms (now Cu⁺ ions) stay in place
- The free electrons can move around between atoms
- When you apply voltage, these electrons flow → **this is electricity!**

### Why Metals Conduct

Metals conduct electricity well because:
1. They have free electrons that can move
2. These electrons can flow from atom to atom
3. When you push on one end (with voltage), electrons flow through

### Why Non-Metals Don't Conduct

Materials like rubber, plastic, or wood hold onto their electrons tightly. There are no free electrons to move around, so they don't conduct electricity. We call these materials **insulators**.

## Why Protons Don't Move

You might wonder: "If electrons can move, why don't protons move too?"

The answer is simple: **protons are stuck in the nucleus**.

- The nucleus is held together by incredibly strong nuclear forces
- Protons are about 2,000 times heavier than electrons
- To remove a proton, you'd need to break apart the nucleus (that's nuclear physics, not electronics!)

In electronics, **only electrons move**. When we talk about "current flow" or "electricity," we're really talking about electrons moving from atom to atom.

## Key Takeaways

✅ Atoms have protons (+), neutrons (neutral), and electrons (-)

✅ Protons are stuck in the nucleus and cannot move

✅ Electrons can move—this is the basis of electricity

✅ Most materials are neutral (equal protons and electrons)

✅ Metals like copper have free electrons that can flow

✅ Insulators hold electrons tightly and don't conduct

✅ Electricity is the movement of electrons through materials

## What's Next?

Now that you understand what charge is and how electrons can move, let's learn about **electric fields**—the invisible force zones that push and pull on charges.
