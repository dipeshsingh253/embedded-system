# Summary and Practice

## Quick Recap of All Concepts

### 1. Charge and Atoms
- Atoms have **protons** (+), **neutrons** (neutral), and **electrons** (-)
- **Protons are stuck** in the nucleus and cannot move
- **Electrons can move** - this is the basis of electricity
- Metals have **free electrons** that can flow
- Electricity is the **movement of electrons**

### 2. Electric Field
- **Electric field** = invisible zone of force around charged objects
- Similar to gravity, but can attract OR repel
- Field lines point from **positive (+) to negative (-)**
- Fields get **weaker with distance**
- Voltage creates electric fields that push electrons

### 3. Ions and Charge Separation
- **Ion** = atom that lost or gained electrons
- **Positive ion**: lost electrons (more protons than electrons)
- **Negative ion**: gained electrons (more electrons than protons)
- **Charge separation** creates voltage
- Chemical reactions can transfer electrons

### 4. Battery Working
- Battery uses **chemical reactions** to separate charges
- **Anode (-)**: electron build-up
- **Cathode (+)**: electron shortage
- **Electrolyte**: blocks electrons, allows ions
- Maintains voltage by continuously separating charges
- Like a **water pump** that keeps circulation going

### 5. Voltage
- **Voltage = electrical pressure**
- Always measured **between two points**
- Unit: **Volts (V)**
- Battery creates voltage through charge separation
- Like **water tank height** (higher = more pressure)

### 6. Current
- **Current = flow of electrons**
- Unit: **Amperes (A)**
- Flows **through** components
- **Conventional current**: + to - (used in analysis)
- **Electron flow**: - to + (physical reality)
- Like **water flow rate** through a pipe
- Needs voltage AND complete path

### 7. Resistance
- **Resistance = opposition to flow**
- Unit: **Ohms (Ω)**
- Caused by electron collisions with atoms
- Depends on: material, length, thickness, temperature
- Longer wire = more resistance
- Thicker wire = less resistance
- Like **pipe friction** or narrowness

### 8. Ohm's Law
- **V = I × R** (and rearrangements)
- More voltage → more current
- More resistance → less current
- Essential for all circuit calculations

### 9. Power
- **Power = energy used per second**
- Unit: **Watts (W)**
- **P = V × I** (also P = I²R and P = V²/R)
- Power converts to heat, light, motion, sound
- **I²R heating**: power increases with square of current
- Components have power ratings

### 10. Units and Conversions
- Common prefixes: **k** (×1000), **m** (÷1000), **μ** (÷1,000,000), **M** (×1,000,000)
- Factor of **1000** between adjacent prefixes
- Always convert to base units before calculations

**1.1:** I = V / R = 9V / 450Ω = **0.02A = 20mA**

**1.2:** V = I × R = 2A × 50Ω = **100V**

**1.3:** R = V / I = 12V / 0.5A = **24Ω**

```
P = V × I
P = 3V × 0.02A = 0.06W = 60mW
```

**2.2:**
```
P = I²R
P = (5A)² × 100Ω = 25 × 100 = 2500W = 2.5kW
```

**2.3:**
```
I = P / V
I = 15W / 5V = 3A
```

**2.4:**
```
P = V²/R
P = (100V)² / 10,000Ω = 10,000 / 10,000 = 1W
```

**2.5:** 250mW = 250 ÷ 1000 = **0.25W**

### Level 3 Answers

**3.1:**
```
Voltage across resistor = 9V - 2V = 7V
R = V / I = 7V / 0.02A = 350Ω
P = V × I = 7V × 0.02A = 0.14W = 140mW
```

**3.2:**
```
Max power = V × I = 5V × 2A = 10W
Actual power = 5V × 1.5A = 7.5W
Resistance = V / I = 5V / 1.5A = 3.33Ω
```

**3.3:**
```
I = P / V = 60W / 120V = 0.5A
R = V / I = 120V / 0.5A = 240Ω
Energy = 60W × 24hr × 30days = 43.2kWh
Cost = 43.2kWh × $0.12/kWh = $5.18
```

**3.4:**
```
R_total = 100Ω + 200Ω + 300Ω = 600Ω
I = V / R = 12V / 600Ω = 0.02A = 20mA
V₁ = 0.02A × 100Ω = 2V
V₂ = 0.02A × 200Ω = 4V
V₃ = 0.02A × 300Ω = 6V
(Check: 2V + 4V + 6V = 12V ✓)
```

**3.5:**
```
R = V / I = 24V / 0.1A = 240Ω
P = V × I = 24V × 0.1A = 2.4W
Safe rating = 2.4W × 2 = 4.8W
1/4W = 0.25W is NOT safe! Need at least 5W resistor
```

### Level 4 Answers

**4.1:**
```
Power consumed = V × I = 12V × 5A = 60W
Mechanical power = 60W × 0.80 = 48W
Heat wasted = 60W - 48W = 12W
Energy = 60W × 2hr = 120Wh = 0.12kWh
```

**4.2:**
```
LED needs resistor: R_LED = (9V - 2V) / 0.02A = 350Ω
Total R = 350Ω + 100Ω = 450Ω
Total I = 9V / 450Ω = 0.02A = 20mA
V_buzzer = 0.02A × 100Ω = 2V
P_buzzer = (0.02A)² × 100Ω = 0.04W = 40mW
P_LED_resistor = 0.02A × 7V = 0.14W = 140mW
P_total = 9V × 0.02A = 0.18W = 180mW
```

**4.3:**
```
I = P / V = 1500W / 120V = 12.5A
R = V / I = 120V / 12.5A = 9.6Ω
P_at_110V = (110V)² / 9.6Ω = 1260W
Energy = 1.5kW × 3hr = 4.5kWh

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

⚠️ **Forgetting to convert units** - Always use base units (A, V, Ω, W) in calculations

⚠️ **Confusing voltage and current** - Voltage is pressure, current is flow

⚠️ **Wrong direction in Ohm's Law** - Use the triangle! I = V/R, not R/V

⚠️ **Ignoring power ratings** - Components can overheat and fail

⚠️ **Forgetting voltage drops** - LEDs drop ~2V, factor this in

⚠️ **Series vs parallel** - Know how resistances combine

⚠️ **Short circuits** - Very low resistance causes dangerous high current

⚠️ **Open circuits** - No complete path = no current
