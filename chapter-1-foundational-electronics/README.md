# Chapter 1: Foundational Electronics

## Overview

Welcome to Chapter 1! This chapter covers the fundamental concepts that form the foundation of all electronics. We'll start from the basics—atoms and charge—and build up to understanding voltage, current, resistance, and power. By the end of this chapter, you'll understand how electricity works and be able to calculate basic circuits using Ohm's Law.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this chapter, you will be able to:

- ✅ Understand what charge is and how it relates to atoms
- ✅ Explain how electric fields work
- ✅ Describe how batteries create and maintain voltage
- ✅ Define voltage, current, and resistance
- ✅ Apply Ohm's Law to calculate circuit values
- ✅ Calculate power in electrical circuits
- ✅ Convert between different units (mA, kΩ, mW, etc.)
- ✅ Analyze series and parallel circuit configurations
- ✅ Solve basic electronics problems

## Prerequisites

**None!** This chapter is designed to be completely beginner-friendly. No prior knowledge of electronics or physics is required. If you can do basic arithmetic (addition, multiplication, division), you're ready to start.

## Recommended Learning Order

📚 **Follow the order above!** Each topic builds on previous ones:

- Start with **atoms and charge** to understand what electricity is
- Learn about **fields** and **ions** to see how charges interact
- Understand **batteries** to see how voltage is created
- Master **voltage, current, and resistance** as the core concepts
- Learn **Ohm's Law** to tie everything together
- Study **power** to understand energy
- Explore **series and parallel circuits** to see how components connect
- Use the **units guide** as a reference
- Complete the **summary** to reinforce your learning

## Time Estimate

- **Quick read-through:** 2-3 hours
- **Deep study with practice:** 4-6 hours
- **Mastery with all problems solved:** 8-10 hours

Take your time! Understanding these fundamentals deeply will make everything else in electronics much easier.

## Tips for Success

💡 **Active Learning**: Don't just read—do the calculations yourself with pen and paper

🔄 **Use Analogies**: Water flow and gravity comparisons make abstract concepts concrete

📝 **Take Notes**: Write down key formulas and concepts in your own words

🧮 **Practice**: Work through all the example problems step by step

❓ **Ask Questions**: If something doesn't make sense, review that section again
